# Rocket League Pro Performance & Earnings Analysis

This repo examines professional Rocket League players’ in-game stats and compares them with their earnings to identify performance trends.

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and clearly convey what your repo is for.

## Overview
This project analyzes in-game stats of professional Rocket League players alongside their tournament earnings to investigate how measurable stats relate to success measured through earnings. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and predictors of earnings, providing insights for esports analysts, and fans interested in understanding what performance factors "matter most" at a pro level.

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Be sure to list where you got any data used within the project. Be sure to acknowledge any one whose work or elements you're drawing upon.

## Current Plan

Prepare data for exploratory analysis
1. Srape both datasets from the web
2. Wrangle the data so that we have a final data frame where a case is a combintation of a Rocket League pro player with their stats and earnings
3. Document our wrangling and scraping process
4. Ensure that all members are aware of the style guide we are using, tidyverse

Setup our Github Repository
1. Create appropriate branches for each member
2. Write out our README file
3. Make sure each member knows how to use Github properly and understands how to commit

Setup our QMD file
1. Using R create a QMD file and make sure the output is set to a PDF file
2. Write out a YAML header with appropriate parameters such as title and authors
3. 

Initial Exploratory data analysis
1. Here we are looking to get familiar with our data before moving past EDA
3. We will create two scatterplots: one comparing average points per game to earnings, and another comparing average goals per game to earnings.
4. Add trend lines to see what has a higher correlation
5. Make sure code is properly formatted and documented

Work in Progress presentation
1. Create an visually appealing slideshow
2. Have one slide be dedicated to showcase what we are interesed in along as what we plan to learn from our data
3. Have another slide showcase our EDA visualizations and the inight we have so far
4. Finally, in our last slide, we discuss potential questions and analyses to investigate beyond our exploratory data analysis
5. Choose a presentation time slot and rehearse
6. Present

Final Exploratory data analysis
1. First, we create a table of the five-number summary statistics to gain further insight into the data
2.
